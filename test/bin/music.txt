To use the music example program it is necessary to obtain an ogg vorbis file (see http://www.kahvi.org/ for tons of options) and make sure that it is at test/bin/data/music.ogg.  I have not included an ogg because to include an entire music file would increase the size of the ZEngine distribution as much as 10x (compressed music [like mp3 and ogg] doesn't recompress well in zip or gz form).

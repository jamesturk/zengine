ZEngine makes use of Zlib along with code from Gilles Vollant's unzip which is
included with Zlib in the contrib/minizip directory.  The Zlib license allows
the embedding which is done for user convinience (and since zlib is a reasonably
stable library).  Information on ZLib's license can be found in zlib-license.txt
which applies to all files found within the include/zlib and src/zlib 
directories.

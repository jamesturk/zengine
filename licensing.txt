This file describes licensing for ZEngine, libs which ZEngine is dependent upon
upon have their own licenses, see readme.txt,lgpl.txt and dependencies.txt for
more info.

A Note From James:
    I chose to license ZEngine under the most liberal license I could find for
a number of reasons.  I really didn't want to think that anybody would steal all
the work put into this and call it their own, and the person that does would do
that even if it were under a more restrictive license.  I would like to know 
where ZEngine is being used, but I'm not going to require it and I'd also like 
to know what you add to it or any problems you find in it.  You shouldn't have 
to be forced to help the community, because it is my belief that most people 
will do what they can, and I can't possibly hope to understand all the complex
scenarios that may prevent someone from using a library under a certain license
so I'd prefer to give the user the freedom to make their code closed-source 
where they feel it should be, but I'd like to encourage everyone to try to give
back to the community when possible.  Generally the people that violate open 
source licenses aren't bright enough to have anything to contribute.

Note: Files in the src/external and include/external directories are not part
of ZEngine, but may be used by ZEngine to interface with external libraries.
Such files are only modified to be compatible with ZEngine and marked where
such modifcations occur.

Note2: The Test files are now public domain, you can use them as a starting
point without concern.

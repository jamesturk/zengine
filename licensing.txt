A Note From James:
    I chose to license ZEngine under the most liberal license I could find.
I really didn't want to think that anybody would steal all the work put into
this engine and call it their own.  I'd like to know if you're using it, but
I didn't choose a license that required it, and I'd also like to know what
you add to it or any problems you find in it, but I'm not going to require
any of that because there are people that will do that and people that
won't and I dont think the people that follow the rule follow it simply
because they have to and the people that violate open source licenses
aren't bright enough to have anything to contribute anyway.

Note: Files in the src/external and include/external directories are not part
of ZEngine, but may be used by ZEngine to interface with external libraries.
Such files are only modified to be compatible with ZEngine and marked where
such modifcations occur.
